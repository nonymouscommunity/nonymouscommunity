## About Us

We are a secular international, and gender-neutral community of cybersecurity enthusiasts. We are here to provide free education to people interested in information technology, cybersecurity and programming, and our motives are clear, we are here to obsolete entities making education a business.


We believe that education is a fundamental human right for everyone. We are here to ensure that no one has been denied the right to obtain education, no matter what ethnicity, group, caste, creed, religion, and gender the person belongs to; human right violation shouldn't be tolerated.


Cybersecurity or Ethical Hacking is one of the fields which is not free and accessible compared to other fields. Various entities take advantage of that and make tons of money off it, leaving this field inaccessible due to a lack of free education, and that's why we are here. To bring change in society and want to revolutionize the world of cybersecurity and free education.


If you are reading this and thinking about supporting the cause, join the community and help people change the world.
